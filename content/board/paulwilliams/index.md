Paul is the co-owner of [High Altitude Archery](https://highaltitudearchery.com), a USA Archery Level 3-NTS coach, and a consultant for Google. Somehow, he found the time and energy to build this organization to benefit the archery community because he feels like archers deserve better, bigger, and more prestigeous events in Colorado.
